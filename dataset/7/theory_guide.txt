DATASET 7 - FEATURE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION
================================================

ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Naive Bayes Classification
2. Information Gain (Feature Selection)

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
- Multi-attribute dataset requiring feature selection
- Binary or multi-class classification problem
- Demonstrates importance of feature engineering

INFORMATION GAIN
===============

DEFINITION:
Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) achieved by partitioning data based on a feature. It quantifies how much information a feature provides about the class.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:

ENTROPY:
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty in a dataset:
H(S) = -Σᵢ pᵢ × log₂(pᵢ)

Where:
- S: Dataset
- pᵢ: Proportion of class i in S
- H(S): Entropy of dataset S

Properties:
- H(S) = 0: Pure dataset (all same class)
- H(S) = 1: Maximum impurity (equal distribution)

INFORMATION GAIN:
IG(S,A) = H(S) - Σᵥ∈Values(A) (|Sᵥ|/|S|) × H(Sᵥ)

Where:
- A: Attribute/Feature
- Values(A): Possible values of attribute A
- Sᵥ: Subset of S where attribute A has value v
- |S|: Size of dataset S

INTERPRETATION:
- Higher IG: Feature provides more information
- IG = 0: Feature provides no information
- Used for feature ranking and selection

BINARY SPLIT FOR CONTINUOUS FEATURES:
====================================

PROBLEM:
Information Gain works naturally with categorical features, but continuous features need discretization.

SOLUTION - BINARY SPLIT:
1. Sort continuous feature values
2. Consider midpoints between consecutive values as split candidates
3. For each candidate, calculate IG with binary split (≤ threshold, > threshold)
4. Choose split with maximum IG
5. Convert continuous feature to binary categorical

ADVANTAGES:
- Simple and interpretable
- Preserves ordering information
- Reduces computational complexity
- Works well with decision trees

EXAMPLE:
Age: [25, 27, 28, 30, 35, 48]
Possible splits: 26, 27.5, 29, 32.5, 41.5
Best split: 32.5 (maximizes IG)
Result: Age_low (≤32.5), Age_high (>32.5)

WHY INFORMATION GAIN?
====================

ADVANTAGES:
1. Quantitative feature importance measure
2. Reduces dimensionality
3. Improves model performance
4. Reduces overfitting
5. Faster training and prediction
6. Better interpretability

APPLICATIONS:
- Feature selection for classification
- Decision tree construction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Understanding data relationships
- Feature engineering guidance

FEATURE SELECTION METHODS:
=========================

FILTER METHODS:
1. Information Gain: Entropy-based ranking
2. Chi-Square Test: Statistical independence
3. Correlation Coefficient: Linear relationships
4. Mutual Information: General dependency measure

WRAPPER METHODS:
1. Forward Selection: Add features iteratively
2. Backward Elimination: Remove features iteratively
3. Recursive Feature Elimination: Systematic removal

EMBEDDED METHODS:
1. Lasso Regression: L1 regularization
2. Ridge Regression: L2 regularization
3. Decision Trees: Built-in feature importance
4. Random Forest: Feature importance scores

COMPARISON OF METHODS:
=====================

INFORMATION GAIN VS CHI-SQUARE:
- IG: Works with any target type, entropy-based
- Chi-Square: Statistical test, requires categorical data

INFORMATION GAIN VS CORRELATION:
- IG: Captures non-linear relationships
- Correlation: Only linear relationships

INFORMATION GAIN VS MUTUAL INFORMATION:
- IG: Special case of MI for classification
- MI: More general, works for any variable types

DECISION TREE CONSTRUCTION:
==========================

INFORMATION GAIN IN TREES:
1. Calculate IG for all features
2. Select feature with highest IG as root
3. Split data based on feature values
4. Recursively build subtrees
5. Stop when pure nodes or max depth reached

ALGORITHMS USING IG:
- ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)
- C4.5 (Improved ID3)
- CART (uses Gini index instead)

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
========================

PREPROCESSING STEPS:
1. Handle missing values
2. Encode categorical variables
3. Normalize/scale numerical features
4. Apply binary split to continuous features
5. Calculate IG for all features

FEATURE SELECTION WORKFLOW:
1. Calculate IG for each feature
2. Rank features by IG score
3. Set threshold or select top-k features
4. Remove low-IG features
5. Train model with selected features
6. Validate performance improvement

EVALUATION:
- Compare model performance before/after selection
- Analyze training time reduction
- Assess interpretability improvement
- Validate on hold-out test set

COMBINING WITH NAIVE BAYES:
===========================

SYNERGY:
1. IG identifies most informative features
2. Naive Bayes uses selected features for classification
3. Reduced feature space improves NB performance
4. Faster training and prediction
5. Better handling of independence assumption

WORKFLOW:
1. Calculate IG for all features
2. Select top features based on IG threshold
