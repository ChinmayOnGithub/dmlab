DATASET 3 - SALARY PREDICTION ANALYSIS
======================================

ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED:
- Linear Regression

DATASET DESCRIPTION:
- Employee data with Age, Salary, and Performance ratings
- Numerical and categorical attributes
- Suitable for regression and prediction tasks

LINEAR REGRESSION
================

DEFINITION:
Linear Regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear equation.

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
Simple Linear Regression: Y = mx + b
Where:
- Y: Dependent variable (target)
- x: Independent variable (feature)
- m: Slope (rate of change)
- b: Y-intercept (value when x=0)

Multiple Linear Regression: Y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ + ... + bₙxₙ

GOAL:
Find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (differences between actual and predicted values).

WHY LINEAR REGRESSION?
=====================

ADVANTAGES:
1. Simple and interpretable
2. Fast training and prediction
3. No hyperparameters to tune
4. Provides coefficient importance
5. Works well for linear relationships
6. Good baseline model
7. Probabilistic predictions possible

DISADVANTAGES:
1. Assumes linear relationship
2. Sensitive to outliers
3. Requires feature scaling
4. Assumes independence of errors
5. May overfit with many features
6. Assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance)

ASSUMPTIONS:
1. Linearity: Relationship between X and Y is linear
2. Independence: Observations are independent
3. Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of residuals
4. Normality: Residuals are normally distributed
5. No multicollinearity: Features are not highly correlated

TYPES OF REGRESSION:
1. Simple Linear: One independent variable
2. Multiple Linear: Multiple independent variables
3. Polynomial: Non-linear relationships using polynomial terms
4. Ridge: L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
5. Lasso: L1 regularization with feature selection
6. Elastic Net: Combination of Ridge and Lasso

EVALUATION METRICS:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared residuals
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute residuals
- R-squared: Proportion of variance explained by model
- Adjusted R-squared: R-squared adjusted for number of features

WHY CHOSEN FOR THIS DATASET:
- Age and Salary have potential linear relationship
- Simple interpretable model for business decisions
- Can handle both numerical and encoded categorical data
- Provides clear coefficient interpretation

ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHMS:
- Polynomial Regression: For non-linear relationships
- Decision Tree Regression: For non-linear, interpretable models
- Random Forest: Ensemble method for better accuracy
- Support Vector Regression: For high-dimensional data
- Neural Networks: For complex non-linear patterns
- Gradient Boosting: For high-performance predictions

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
- Salary prediction based on experience
- Sales forecasting
- Price estimation
- Risk assessment
- Economic modeling
- Performance prediction

DATA PREPROCESSING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Handle categorical variables (encoding)
- Scale numerical features if needed
- Remove or handle outliers
- Check for multicollinearity
- Validate linear relationship assumptions

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
- Create polynomial features for non-linearity
- Interaction terms between features
- Log transformations for skewed data
- Binning continuous variables
- Domain-specific feature creation

MODEL INTERPRETATION:
- Coefficient values show feature importance
- Positive/negative coefficients show relationship direction
- Intercept represents baseline prediction
- R-squared shows model explanatory power
- Residual analysis reveals model adequacy
