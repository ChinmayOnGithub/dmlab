- Mixed data types requiring preprocessing

NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFICATION - DETAILED THEORY
===========================================

DEFINITION:
Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between features.

BAYES' THEOREM FOUNDATION:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)

For Classification:
P(Class|Features) = P(Features|Class) × P(Class) / P(Features)

NAIVE ASSUMPTION:
All features are conditionally independent given the class:
P(x₁,x₂,...,xₙ|y) = P(x₁|y) × P(x₂|y) × ... × P(xₙ|y)

This simplifies computation but rarely holds in real data.

CLASSIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Calculate prior probabilities P(Class)
2. Calculate likelihoods P(Feature|Class) for each feature
3. Apply Bayes' theorem to get posterior probabilities
4. Classify to class with highest posterior probability

TYPES OF NAIVE BAYES:
====================

1. GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES:
- For continuous features
- Assumes normal distribution
- P(xᵢ|y) = (1/√(2πσ²)) × exp(-(xᵢ-μ)²/(2σ²))

2. MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES:
- For discrete count data
- Common in text classification
- P(xᵢ|y) = (count(xᵢ,y) + α) / (count(y) + α×n)

3. BERNOULLI NAIVE BAYES:
- For binary features
- Models presence/absence of features
- P(xᵢ|y) = P(xᵢ=1|y)×xᵢ + (1-P(xᵢ=1|y))×(1-xᵢ)

LAPLACE SMOOTHING:
=================
Problem: Zero probabilities when feature-class combination not seen in training
Solution: Add small constant α (usually 1) to all counts
P(xᵢ|y) = (count(xᵢ,y) + α) / (count(y) + α×|V|)

WHY NAIVE BAYES?
===============

STRENGTHS:
1. Fast training and prediction
2. Requires small training datasets
3. Handles multi-class classification naturally
4. Not sensitive to irrelevant features
5. Good performance with categorical data
6. Provides probability estimates
7. Simple to implement and understand

WEAKNESSES:
1. Strong independence assumption
2. Can be outperformed by more sophisticated methods
3. Poor estimator for probability
4. Requires smoothing for unseen feature combinations
5. Sensitive to skewed data

WHEN TO USE NAIVE BAYES:
- Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)
- Medical diagnosis
- Real-time predictions (fast inference needed)
- Baseline model for comparison
- Small datasets
- High-dimensional data
- Multi-class problems

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
========================

FEATURE SELECTION:
- Remove irrelevant features
- Use mutual information
- Apply chi-square test
- Consider correlation analysis

DATA PREPROCESSING:
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features (for Gaussian NB)
- Remove outliers if necessary

MODEL TUNING:
- Adjust smoothing parameter α
- Choose appropriate NB variant
- Consider feature transformations
- Use cross-validation for evaluation

EVALUATION STRATEGIES:
=====================

METRICS:
- Accuracy: Overall correctness
- Precision: P = TP/(TP+FP)
- Recall: R = TP/(TP+FN)
- F1-Score: F1 = 2×(P×R)/(P+R)
- AUC-ROC: Area under ROC curve
- Confusion Matrix: Detailed error analysis

VALIDATION:
- K-fold cross-validation
- Stratified sampling
- Hold-out validation
- Bootstrap sampling

COMPARISON WITH OTHER ALGORITHMS:
================================

VS LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
- NB: Faster, works with small data
- LR: Better calibrated probabilities, handles correlated features

VS DECISION TREES:
- NB: Faster, probabilistic output
- DT: More interpretable, handles non-linear relationships

VS SVM:
