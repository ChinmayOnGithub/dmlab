QUESTION 1: BASIC STATISTICS AND CORRELATION
==========================================

DIFFICULTY: ⭐ EASY

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You are given a dataset with student information. Calculate the correlation coefficient between two numeric attributes and determine if there's a strong, moderate, or weak correlation.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Read the CSV file
2. Show available columns to user
3. Let user select 2 numeric columns
4. Calculate correlation coefficient using the formula:
   r = Σ(xi-x̄)(yi-ȳ) / √[Σ(xi-x̄)²Σ(yi-ȳ)²]
5. Display the correlation value
6. Interpret the result:
   - |r| > 0.7: Strong correlation
   - 0.3 < |r| ≤ 0.7: Moderate correlation  
   - |r| ≤ 0.3: Weak correlation
7. Save results to output.csv

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
========================
Available columns:
0: Name
1: Age  
2: Height
3: Weight

Enter first column index: 2
Enter second column index: 3

Correlation Analysis:
====================
Attribute 1: Height
Attribute 2: Weight
Correlation coefficient: 0.85
Interpretation: Strong positive correlation
