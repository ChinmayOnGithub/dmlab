# DATA MINING PRACTICE QUESTIONS

## Instructions:
- Start with Question 1 and work your way up
- Each question has a dataset and problem statement
- Code everything from scratch (no copying from existing folders)
- Use the universal CSV reader pattern you learned
- Test your code with the provided dataset
- Move to next question only after completing current one

## Difficulty Progression:
- Questions 1-3: EASY (Basic operations)
- Questions 4-6: MEDIUM (Standard algorithms) 
- Questions 7-9: HARD (Complex implementations)

## Success Criteria:
- Code compiles without errors
- Produces correct output format
- Handles CSV input/output properly
- Follows Part A methodology (attribute selection, exploration, preprocessing, algorithm)

Good luck! 🚀
